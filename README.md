# 3D Number Visualizer With The UMAP Algorithm
A toolkit for visualizing the number factorization in a traversable 3-dimensional space utilizing the UMAP algorithm with Python and OpenGL.

mapper.py for generating the data
and data_loader.py for loading the data

# How It Works
First we factorize numbers and represent them into N-dimensional vectors, next week use machine learning to reduce the dimensionality of the vectors from ND to 3D, and finally we visualize the results.


Numbers are colored based on the number of neighbors.


Stand out prime numbers form a spherical structure.
